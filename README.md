# Spotify Remote Atom package!

## the current version only supports Linux, Windows and IOS compatibility is in the oven~~

Hi! this is a beta version of the Spotify Remote controller for Atom.io

It uses gdbus to send commands to the client, there are some issues with the Spotify gdbus API, one of them is to get the current position of the track being played.

Right now you can only play, pause, go to next song and to the previous one with your keyboard, having a visual response showing the current track and it's status

more features comming~~
feel free to send a pull request with new additions
